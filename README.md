Thank you for the opportunity to learn more about Figment through this interview process.

Here you will find the code for part 3 - Automation of the take home assesment.

You will also the see the CSV table files and an Excel spreadsheet with my findings.

There are two tables:  
delegators.csv  
rewards.csv  

I think that 2 tabeles will normalize the data and allow us to query the 2 month statistics!

You can also view some helper screenshots in the helper-screenshots directory that show you how to navigate an explorer.

Thank you - Justin Bishop March 28, 2025
